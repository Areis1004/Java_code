equals() and hashCode() methods in java


Number

int x,int y


Number n1=new Number(10,20)
override equals and hashcode();;;

it should make comparison on basis of x and y;

Number n2=new Number(10,20)

if(n1.x==n2.x)
{
	if(n1.y==n2.y)
	{
		return true;
	}
	else


hashcode()
{
return x+y;

n1=30;
n2=30
}

n1=  10 30
n2= 20 20

1) if two objects are equals they will always have same hashcode.
2)if two objects have same hashcode it is not necessary they are equal.
